# Emergency Messaging Application (EMA)

This is a "fork" of my thesis from University, which I aim to refactor and improve. With the goal to make it: more modular, more secure, and more efficient.




## Authors
[carlitorlando](https://github.com/carlitorlando) for designing the initial layouts of the application.

[edrinto](https://github.com/edrinto) for implementing the security aspect of the application, importing the bouncycastle library.


## Acknowledgements

I wouldn't be able to build this during University days, without these guys:

 - [carlitorlando](https://github.com/carlitorlando)
 - [edrinto](https://github.com/edrinto)

I would also like to thank the creator of the serial library for Android, which made it easier for us to interface the arduino and android phones.
